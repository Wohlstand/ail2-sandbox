This guide presents style considerations you can follow when
designing Borland Windows Custom Control (BWCC) dialog boxes for
your Windows-based software.


1        Layout issues
----------------------

Before you begin designing your dialogs, you should be aware of
some basic design considerations.


1.1      Panels
---------------

Each dialog box has two panels: a Main panel and an Action panel.
The Main panel contains all the elements that are read or
modified when the dialog box is open. The Action panel contains
the push buttons, usually OK, Cancel, and Help.


1.2      Fonts
--------------

Borland dialogs use 8 point Helvetica Bold. The BWCC dialog
controls look best when you use this font. An 8 point font is
small; using it keeps the size of the your dialogs from growing
too big. Of course, you can use other fonts for other custom
controls.


1.3      Group Boxes
--------------------

Collect all options that appear in the Main panel into BWCC group
boxes. For example, place a group of related check boxes in a
group box. You should place each single control, such as a file
name text box or combo box, in a group box also. You won't have
to do this with a Borland list box because a list box draws its
own group box.


1.4      Push buttons
---------------------

The following are style considerations for push buttons:

- Borland's push buttons use glyphs (small bitmapped images). For
  example, a question-mark glyph is used on the Help push button.
  Place the glyph inside the button on the left side.

- Use Helvetica (normal, not bold) for the button's text and
  justify it to the right.

- Make each push button 39 pixels high for VGA resolution and 30
  pixels high for EGA resolution.

- Most push buttons are 63 pixels wide in both VGA and EGA
  resolution. Although you can make a button wider to prevent the
  text and image from overlapping or looking too crowded, you
  should try to restrict the width to 63 pixels if possible.


2        Dimension and alignment guidelines
-------------------------------------------

The following sections present guidelines for laying out the
controls in a BWCC dialog box.


2.1      Arranging the panels
-----------------------------

The Main panel of your dialog should be as large as necessary to
contain all the required controls. The Action panel should be
just big enough to contain the push buttons; you can place it
either at the bottom or the right side of the dialog.

Your finished dialog should be relatively square. If the Main
panel is wider than it is tall, put the Action panel along the
bottom of your dialog. If the Main panel is taller than it is
wide, put the Action panel on the right side.


2.2      Main panel
-------------------

You may arrange the group boxes on the Main panel in either a
single column or row, or in an array. Here are some guidelines to
arranging group boxes on the Main panel. You should treat group
titles as part of the group boxes.

- Space group boxes 8 dialog units apart, both vertically and
  horizontally.

- Leave a margin of 8 dialog units from all edges of the dialog
  to the nearest group box.

- In a column of group boxes, make all group boxes the same
  width. The width should accommodate the widest item or title.
  Widen the other group boxes to match.

- In a row of group boxes, you may vary the group box heights.
  Align the tops of the group boxes and let the bottoms of the
  group boxes vary.

- If some of the group boxes you want to align in a row have
  titles and some don't, align the top of the recessed group
  boxes with each other, not with the title rectangles. For these
  mixed groups of boxes, the margin above group boxes without
  titles should include the space for a title.

- If some of the group boxes you want to align in a row are
  taller than others, compute the bottom margin using the tallest
  group box.


2.3      Horizontal action panel
--------------------------------

An Action panel that appears at the bottom of a dialog is a
horizontal Action panel. It extends the full width of the dialog.
Here are the guidelines:

- Make the Action panel tall enough to contain the push buttons
  while leaving a margin of 8 dialog units above and 8 dialog
  units below the push buttons.

- Distribute the push buttons evenly along the Action panel,
  leaving a minimum of 8 dialog units between the buttons
  themselves and between the buttons and the left and right edges
  of the dialog.

  Try to use the same number of dialog units between each button
  and between the buttons and the left and right edges of the
  dialog. You may put more space between the buttons than between
  the buttons and the edges of the dialog, if necessary, but the
  two margin spaces should be equal and the spaces between the
  buttons should be equal.


2.4      Vertical action panel
------------------------------

An Action panel that appears at the right side of a dialog is a
vertical Action panel. It extends the full height of the dialog.
Here are the guidelines:

- Make the Action panel wide enough to contain the push buttons
  while leaving a margin of 8 dialog units to right and 8 dialog
  units to the left of the push buttons.

- Distribute the push buttons evenly along the Action panel,
  leaving a minimum of 8 dialog units between the buttons
  themselves and between the buttons and the top and bottom edges
  of the dialog.

  Try to use the same number of dialog units between each button
  and between the buttons and the top and bottom edges of the
  dialog. You may put more space between the buttons than between
  the buttons and the edges of the dialog, if necessary, but the
  two margin spaces must be equal and the spaces between the
  buttons must be equal.


2.5      Group box titles
-------------------------

A group box title identifies what a group box contains. By
default, a group box title in a Borland dialog has a gray
background. The following are the guidelines for group boxes:

- If a group box contains multiple controls, place the group box
  title just above and touching the top edge of the group box.

- If a group box contains a single check box, place the group box
  title just above and touching the top edge of the group box.

- If a group box contains a single text box or combo box control,
  either put the title to the left of the control and 4 units
  from the edge of the group box or put it above the control,
  whichever you prefer.

- If a group box contains two or more editable text fields or
  combo boxes or both, precede each with a short label.

- Align group box titles above the recessed group boxes.

- Make all group box titles 9 units high.

- Make the titles the same width as the group boxes, including
  the beveled sides.


2.6      Group box elements
---------------------------

These suggestions will help you arrange the elements within a
group box:

- Distribute controls within a group box vertically every 13
  units from the bottom of one line of text to the bottom of the
  next.

- Justify the controls to the left.

- Make the left and right margins between the edges of the group
  box and the widest control within it all 4 dialog units wide.

- Make the margin between the top of the group box and the first
  control in the group 4 dialog units.

- Make the margin between the bottom of the group box and the
  last control in the group 4 dialog units.

- If a group box contains two or more editable text fields or
  combo boxes or both, make them the same width. Space them so
  that the bottom of one is 13 units apart from the bottom of the
  next one. Right-justify these controls in the group box 4 units
  from the right edge. Left-justify the titles, leaving a 4 unit
  margin. Make the group box wide enough to leave 4 units between
  the longest title and its control.


2.7      Message boxes
----------------------

Like dialog boxes, messages boxes have two panels: a Main panel
and an Action panel.

The Main panel of the message box is filled with a single group
box. The group box contains a message glyph and a text region.

Here are the guidelines for designing a message box:

- Put the glyph on the left side of the group box.

- Leave a margin of 8 dialog units on all four sides of the group
  box.

- Space the message glyph and the text region 8 dialog units
  apart.

- Center the text region vertically, leaving at least 8 dialog
  units between the top and bottom of the text region and the top
  and bottom edges of the dialog.

- Place the Action panel at the bottom of your dialog.

- Test this layout using your longest message string. If
  necessary, resize the text region accordingly.


2.8      Examining your dialog
------------------------------

When Windows calculates dialog units, it rounds the computation.
Rounding errors may affect the appearance of your dialog. Examine
your dialog carefully. These problems have been noted:

- A crack between the title text and the top of a gray group box

- Obvious uneven spacing in a vertical group of radio buttons or
  check boxes

- An inconsistent border width in exposed panel areas

Usually, making an adjustment of 1 dialog unit will fix these
problems. Occasionally in a large group of repeating controls,
two or more rounding errors can occur. Sometimes making an
adjustment can improve the layout of your dialog; at other times
you may decide not to make any changes. Use your best judgment.

You can't tell how text in controls will appear when you are
designing your dialog. Editable text, large static text fields,
and combo boxes fall into this category. You may have to modify
your original design to be sure text appears correctly without
being clipped at run time.


2.9      Using standard push buttons
------------------------------------

The Action panel push buttons usually indicate the end of a
user's work with a dialog, but can also serve as a major
departure from the function of the dialog, such as bringing up
Help with the Help button.

An application can also have push buttons that don't result in
closure. With these buttons, the user wants to perform specific
actions but continue working with the dialog. Groups of these
buttons often have related functions.

For example, a Search dialog box could have Action panel buttons
for Find Next and Replace.

The guidelines for standard buttons are as follows:

- Put these push buttons on the Main panel rather than the Action
  panel.

- Don't put these push buttons in a group box. Place them
  directly on the surface of the Main panel.

- Make all push buttons in a group the same width. They should be
  just wide enough to accommodate the widest text string.

- Make the buttons 14 dialog units in height.

- Try to restrict text to 20 characters or less.

- Lay the buttons out in either a row or a column, depending on
  what looks best in your dialog.

- Leave 8 dialog units to the left and right of a column of push
  buttons. The vertical space between the buttons and any other
  controls or borders above or below the buttons should be equal.

- Leave 8 dialog units above and below a row of push buttons. The
  horizontal space between the buttons and any other controls or
  borders to the left or right of them should be equal.
